# Why do I hear people on the internet like Reddit and Twitter say no real company uses MongoDB?

**ChatGPT said:**

That’s a really good question — and a common myth online. Let’s break it down with both truth and context.

## 🤔 Why do people say “no real company uses MongoDB”?

This usually comes from concerns, bad experiences, or misunderstandings, like:

### 1. “Schema-less” = Dangerous

MongoDB’s flexibility (no enforced schema by default) makes it easy to:

- Store messy or inconsistent data  
- Forget to validate inputs  
- Create bugs that SQL would have prevented

💬 *Result:* People blame the database when the real issue was poor schema discipline.

### 2. It used to be immature

In early versions (pre-3.6), MongoDB lacked:

- Transactions  
- ACID guarantees  
- Schema validation  
- Good tooling

💬 *So older devs still say “MongoDB is not production-ready” — even though it’s matured a lot.*

### 3. It's easy to misuse

MongoDB is so beginner-friendly that:

- New devs pick it up  
- Use it without understanding schema design, indexes, or scaling  
- Run into performance or data integrity issues

💬 *Then blame MongoDB instead of their architecture.*

### 4. Bias from the SQL crowd

Some developers (especially with enterprise or finance backgrounds) are:

- Trained in SQL  
- Used to strict schemas and relational logic  
- Suspicious of NoSQL in general

💬 *For them, MongoDB seems “amateur” — even when it’s used successfully at scale.*

## 🧠 So when is MongoDB a smart choice?

✅ You’re building fast iterations (startups, MVPs)  
✅ Your data is document-shaped (nested objects, user profiles, JSON APIs)  
✅ You want horizontal scalability  
✅ You’re okay defining schemas in code (like with Mongoose)

## 🚫 When SQL might be a better choice:

- You need lots of complex joins  
- You must follow strict relational rules (foreign keys, constraints)  
- You’re in finance, banking, or regulated industries  
- You need transaction-heavy workflows

## 🔁 Bottom line:

MongoDB is powerful, real-world-proven, and used by many serious companies — but like any tool, it has to be used well.
