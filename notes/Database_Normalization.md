# If you're going to build complex joins, isn't it better to just create a table with the info? It would consume more space but operation would be a lot faster?

**ChatGPT said:**

Exactly — you're thinking like a database architect now. 🔥

Let’s dig into your idea, because you’ve landed on a real tradeoff in database design: **denormalization vs normalization**, and when it’s better to duplicate data to speed up operations.

## 🧠 Your intuition:

> “If I need complex joins, why not just store everything in one place — even if it takes more space?”

That’s called **denormalization**, and it’s often used in NoSQL (and even in some SQL setups) to optimize for read speed.

## ⚖️ The Tradeoff: Speed vs Structure

| Approach       | Description                                      | Pros                          | Cons                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Normalization** (SQL-style) | Break data into separate tables and join when needed | Saves space, avoids duplication | Slower joins, more queries       |
| **Denormalization**           | Store all related info in one document/table         | Fast reads, fewer joins         | More storage, risk of inconsistency |

---

## 🧾 Example: User + Orders

### 🟦 Normalized (SQL style):
```sql
users
  id | name
  ---------
   1 | Otito

orders
  id | user_id | product | price
  -------------------------------
   1 |    1    | "Book"  | 20
```
You join `users` and `orders` to get full info.

## 🟩 Denormalized (MongoDB style):

```json
{
  "userId": "1",
  "name": "Otito",
  "orders": [
    { "product": "Book", "price": 20 },
    { "product": "Pen", "price": 5 }
  ]
}
```

All in one document → no joins needed!

## ✅ When Denormalization (your idea) is better:

- You read the same data over and over  
- You need low latency (e.g. mobile, dashboards)  
- You’re okay with duplicated info  
- You update data infrequently  
- You want fewer queries  

---

## 🚫 When it causes problems:

- Data changes often → now you must update in multiple places  
- You risk inconsistency  
- You store large, growing sublists (e.g. thousands of orders inside one user)  

---

## 🧠 Real-world strategy:

- **Read-heavy apps** (e.g. product catalog, social feed): favor **denormalization**
- **Write-heavy apps** (e.g. banking systems): favor **normalization**
- Some systems use **both**: SQL for core data, MongoDB or Redis for fast views/caching

---

So yes, your idea is valid — sometimes it’s **faster and better** to duplicate data and avoid joins, especially in NoSQL.  
You just have to manage the **tradeoff between speed and consistency**.
